Produkten blir en solid stav som sedan valsas till ett 8-kantigt plans som syns i bilden. Därefter kan vi påbörja arbetet med att forma ett smycke.\\nUnika smycken\\nUnika smycken tycker vi är extra roligt att arbeta med. Ett smycke där du som kund kan bestämma exakt vad du vill ha, givetvis gärna i samråd med oss. Bara fantasin sätter gränsen.\\nVigselringar\\nVigsel & förlovningsringar är bland det roligaste vi vet! Att få möjligheten att skapa ett så personligt smycke, för ett så viktigt tillfälle i livet, är alltid roligt oavsett vilken typ av ring det handlar om. Vi gör ringar av alla dess slag, med stenar eller släta, i guld eller silver. Har du en idé om hur du vill att din ring skall se ut eller om du vill få hjälp med att hitta din favoritring så kontakta oss.\\nDick’s Guld & Silver\\nAdress: Hästgatan 18a , 621 56 Visby   |   Telefon: 0498-25 67 68\\nDick: 0703-28 70 94   |   Björn: 0708-18 42 79   |   E-post: info@dicksguld.se\\n© Dick´s Guld & Silver  |  » Om cookies  |  » Sitemap\\nPowered by SiteSmart'"

DrawbacksTo lock in the lowest interest rates you will need an above-average credit score.\",\n",
       "  'Time to receive funds': 'funds you get from family and friends up to the lesser of $2,000 or 1% of the purchase price. Homebuyers can earn bonus money toward the grant, including when their campaign is shared on social media platforms through the links on the campaign page. Qualifying homebuyers in all states but Alaska and Hawaii may be eligible to get up to $2,500 toward down payment or closing costs with the Freddie Mac BorrowSmart Program. Borrowers must meet income requirements and complete prepurchase counseling. CMG Mortgage also offers the All In One Loan, which combines home financing and banking, allowing you to make deposits that lower your loan’s principal. Those funds are available for expenses, and interest is calculated on the average daily balance. The result is lower monthly interest payments and an ability to reduce the time it takes to pay off your loan. Specific requirements in addition to minimum credit score vary by product. Conventional loans, for example, require that the applicant have a debt-to-income ratio of 45% or lower. Some conventional loans have options for down payment requirements as low as 3% or 5%, but a down payment lower than 20% necessitates that the borrower pay private mortgage insurance. Government-backed loans also have their own requirements. To qualify for a USDA loan, prospective borrowers must meet income requirements and be purchasing a home in a USDA-approved area. Factors for FHA 203(k) renovation loan eligibility include that applicants must have a DTI ratio not exceeding 43%, the home must be the applicants’ primary residence and meet Department of Housing and Urban Development guidelines, and repair costs must be at least $5,000.  To qualify for a CMG conventional home loan, you’ll need a credit score of at least 620, though CMG will also figure in DTI, savings and down payment size. FHA, USDA and VA loans can sometimes have lower credit score thresholds. For example, you may qualify for an FHA loan with CMG Mortgage if you have a FICO score of at least 580. You may need a higher credit score to qualify for a jumbo loan; CMG says prospective borrowers hoping to get a jumbo loan should have a score around 680 or above.CMG Mortgage is licensed in all 50 states and Washington, D.C.

Navy Federal works with members who have credit scores that might not be accepted by traditional lending institutions. Is your dream home within reach? U.S. News’ mortgage calculator will show you how much house you can afford.Navy Federal Credit Union has an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau, but the lender is not BBB-accredited. The credit union closed 345 complaints during the last 12 months, many of which were related to product problems, billing or collections. Navy Federal Credit Union addressed these complaints in a timely manner. In 2021, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau received 219 mortgage-related complaints about Navy Federal Credit Union, mostly related to the application process. Navy Federal provided timely responses to these complaints; 116 closed with explanation, 19 closed with monetary relief, 18 closed with nonmonetary relief and 21 were still in progress as of January 2022.As for customer service, one factor to note: Navy Federal’s materials and documents are only available in English. The credit union also only conducts business in English, though it will “attempt to assist members who have limited English proficiency where possible.”Borrowers can apply for a mortgage online and manage their accounts through the credit union’s website. First, Navy Federal requires you to get preapproved based on your credit score, income, assets, debts, employment history and other financial information like bank statements and pay stubs. Navy Federal will verify this information and preapprove you for a certain loan amount. When you’re ready to buy a home, you can move on to the application process by contacting your home loan advisor. You’ll need to supply: W-2s for the last two years, pay stubs for the last few months, personal tax returns for the last two years, your Social Security number, monthly debt and living expenses, and bank statements and asset information from financial institutions other than Navy Federal. Active-duty military, veterans, DOD civilians or contractors, and their family membersMember borrowers who want a mortgage with no PMI or down paymentThose who are looking for a lender with VA loan expertiseQ: What is Freedom Lock?A: Freedom Lock is a benefit Navy Federal offers to help you get the lowest interest rate on your mortgage. Once you complete your application and you’ve found the home you wish to buy, you’ll need to choose your rate lock option, which determines what happens with your mortgage rate. If you “lock” your rate, you stick with the current rate – this is a good option if you think rates will go higher before you close on your home. If you think rates will go lower, you can opt to “float,” and then lock in your rate at a lower level right before you close.The third option is typically called a “lock float down” – you can lock in your rate but keep the option to change it if mortgage rates fall during your lock period. Mortgage lenders typically charge for this option, but Navy Federal offers it for free. Hence, Freedom Lock. With Freedom Lock, you can relock your mortgage rate twice, as long as your mortgage closes within 60 days of the first rate lock.Q: Is Navy Federal Credit Union legit?A: Navy Federal Credit Union is the largest credit union in the United States. Navy Federal was founded in 1933 to provide financial solutions to those who serve the United States and their families. The Better Business Bureau gives Navy Federal an A+ rating, though it is not accredited. The 2020 J.D. Power &amp; Associates U.S. Primary Mortgage Origination Satisfaction Study ranked Navy Federal Credit Union as above-average. In 2020, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau received 229 mortgage-related complaints about Navy Federal Credit Union.Q: How do you get approved for a Navy Federal Credit Union mortgage?A: To get approved for a Navy Federal Credit Union mortgage, you must be a member. First, secure loan preapproval. You’ll need to provide basic financial information, including your credit score and employment history. While some types of mortgages have minimum credit score requirements, Navy Federal says it works with members to find the best mortgage option for each situation, even for those who have less-than-perfect credit. Your preapproval letter states how much money you’re approved to borrow to purchase a home. Once you find a home in your price range that you want to buy, you’ll contact your loan advisor, provide additional financial details, and convert your preapproval into a formal loan application.\",\"@type\":\"NewsArticle\",\"author\":[{\"image\":\"https:\\\\u002F\\\\u002Fwww.usnews.com\\\\u002Fdims4\\\\u002FUSNEWS\\\\u002F40351df\\\\u002F2147483647\\\\u002Fthumbnail\\\\u002F300x300\\\\u002Fquality\\\\u002F85\\\\u002F?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.beam.usnews.com%2F29%2Fb7%2F72e9a69f4f138060dec967022b09%2Fkristen-hampshire.jpg\",\"@type\":\"Person\",\"jobTitle\":\"Contributor\",\"name\":\"Kristen Hampshire\",\"url\":\"https:\\\\u002F\\\\u002Fwww.usnews.com\\\\u002Ftopics\\\\u002Fauthor\\\\u002Fkristen-hampshire\"}],\"description\":\"Read U.S. News\\' review of Navy Federal Credit Union Mortgage and compare interest rates, fees and terms to find the best loan for you.\",\"Product\":{\"image\":{\"@type\":\"ImageObject\",\"url\":\"https:\\\\u002F\\\\u002Fwww.usnews.com\\\\u002Fdims4\\\\u002FUSNEWS\\\\u002Fd9ff223\\\\u002F2147483647\\\\u002Fthumbnail\\\\u002F300x300\\\\u002Fquality\\\\u002F85\\\\u002F?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.beam.usnews.com%2F8e%2Fbf%2F029893cf4ec5b35994aaa4d0e821%2Fnavy-federal-credit-union-logo.svg.png\"},\"@type\":\"Product\",\"name\":\"Navy Federal Credit Union\",\"description\":\"Read U.S. News\\' review of Navy Federal Credit Union Mortgage and compare interest rates, fees and terms to find the best loan for you.\",\"aggregateRating\":{\"reviewCount\":\"1\",\"@type\":\"AggregateRating\",\"ratingValue\":3.9}},\"dateModified\":\"2022-07-20T09:00-0400\",\"mainEntityOfPage\":{\"@type\":\"WebPage\",\"name\":\"Navy Federal Credit Union Mortgage Review\",\"@id\":\"https:\\\\u002F\\\\u002Fmoney.usnews.com\\\\u002Floans\\\\u002Fmortgages\\\\u002Freviews\\\\u002Fnavyfederalcreditunion-mortgage\",\"url\":\"https:\\\\u002F\\\\u002Fmoney.usnews.com\\\\u002Floans\\\\u002Fmortgages\\\\u002Freviews\\\\u002Fnavyfederalcreditunion-mortgage\"},\"@context\":\"http:\\\\u002F\\\\u002Fwww.schema.org\",\"datePublished\":\"2022-07-20T09:00-0400\",\"dateCreated\":\"2022-07-20T09:00-0400\",\"publisher\":{\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"name\":\"U.S. News & World Report\",\"logo\":{\"@type\":\"ImageObject\",\"width\":193,\"url\":\"https:\\\\u002F\\\\u002Fwww.usnews.com\\\\u002Fstatic\\\\u002Fimages\\\\u002Fusn-logo-print.png\",\"height\":46}},\"headline\":\"Navy Federal Credit Union Mortgage Review\",\"thumbnailUrl\":\"https:\\\\u002F\\\\u002Fwww.usnews.com\\\\u002Fdims4\\\\u002FUSNEWS\\\\u002F74614ab\\\\u002F2147483647\\\\u002Fthumbnail\\\\u002F80x60\\\\u002Fquality\\\\u002F85\\\\u002F?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.beam.usnews.com%2F8e%2Fbf%2F029893cf4ec5b35994aaa4d0e821%2Fnavy-federal-credit-union-logo.svg.png\"},\"refinance_variable_apr\":\"\",\"id\":\"00000168-5723-dd26-a57e-57efb3690000\",\"overline\":{\"new_window\":false,\"text\":\"Mortgages and Advice\",\"permalink\":\"\",\"url\":\"https:\\\\u002F\\\\u002Fmoney.usnews.com\\\\u002Floans\\\\u002Fmortgages\"},\"headline\":\"Navy Federal Credit Union Mortgage Review\",\"short_summary\":\"Navy Federal Credit Union serves more than 11 million active-duty and retired military, veteran, and Department of Defense members as well as their families.

These include an application fee, appraisal fee, credit report fee, origination fee, title search fee and other fees that vary depending on locality. If you find another mortgage with a better interest rate, Freedom Mortgage will match the competitor’s rate or give you $250. You may also buy discount points – which reduce your interest rate – for some mortgages, with one point equal to 1% of the total loan amount.You can qualify for a Freedom Mortgage loan if you have fair credit because the lender offers FHA, VA and USDA loans that have lower minimum credit limits than conventional mortgages. Qualifying for a Freedom Mortgage loan includes proving you are a U.S. citizen with a steady income and established credit. The lender will review your debt-to-income ratio and request your Social Security number, pay stubs, W-2s and bank statements. Ultimately, qualifying for a mortgage from Freedom Mortgage is about proving you have the means to pay back what it lends to you. Generally, a credit score of 580 to 620 is required for VA loans, but Freedom Mortgage will work with borrowers who have a credit score lower than 580. As for FHA loans, the minimum credit score is 540. Freedom Mortgage does not disclose a minimum credit score for all of its loans, but says it focuses on providing homeownership opportunities for borrowers, so the lender will look beyond the credit score and consider credit history, payment history, debt-to-income ratio, income and employment. Freedom Mortgage has a B+ rating with the Better Business Bureau and is a BBB-accredited business. It closed 499 complaints during the last 12 months. The lender addressed complaints within a few weeks. TrustPilot gives Freedom Mortgage 2.5 out of 5 stars, based on 12 reviews. In 2021, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau fielded 760 complaints about Freedom Mortgage loans. The most common complaints involved trouble during the payment process and applying for a mortgage. The lender responded in a timely manner to all complaints; 742 closed with explanation, and 18 were in progress as of January 2022. Freedom Mortgage doesn’t offer online prequalification and application processes. You can fill out an online form with your contact information, and a loan advisor will contact you. For some borrowers who prefer to do business online, this could be an inconvenience. But the benefit of an in-person or on-the-phone application process is a loan advisor will walk you through the application and answer your questions, ensuring that all steps are properly completed. As your loan closes, you’ll work with a scheduling coordinator who acts as an advocate and ushers the application to the final close. After this, Freedom Mortgage does have online tools so you can manage your account and pay bills online. People who would rather not apply for a loan onlineBorrowers who want a lender that is experienced with VA and FHA loansResidents of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands FAQs About Freedom Mortgage LoansQ: How do Freedom Mortgage loans work?Freedom Mortgage offers a range of home loans, including FHA, VA, USDA, conventional, adjustable-rate, jumbo and refinancing. If you want to apply for a Freedom Mortgage loan, you can compare the products online and fill out a form so a loan advisor will call you. You cannot complete the prequalification or application processes online, but you will be able to manage your account online once your loan closes. Q: Is Freedom Mortgage legit?Freedom Mortgage has a B+ rating from the Better Business Bureau and received 493 complaints during the last 12 months, which the lender addressed in a timely manner. TrustPilot gives Freedom Mortgage 2.5 out of 5 stars, which is a lower ranking than other mortgage lenders we profiled. Sixty percent of the reviews were “bad” on TrustPilot. Meanwhile, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau received 773 complaints about Freedom Mortgage loans, and the lender responded in a reasonable amount of time. Q: How do you get approved for a Freedom Mortgage loan?You get approved for a Freedom Mortgage loan by first prequalifying and then completing the application process, which involves proving you are U.S. citizen, showing you have a steady income, reporting annual income and providing your Social Security number. Freedom Mortgage pulls your credit report to review your score, credit history, payment history and debt-to-income ratio. Because Freedom Mortgage provides FHA, VA and USDA loans, the minimum credit score is lower than what might be required for a conventional loan from a conservative lender. Freedom Mortgage says it is focused on giving Americans an opportunity to own homes, which plays into its willingness to consider those with credit limits of 580 and sometimes lower.\",\"@type\":\"NewsArticle\",\"author\":[{\"image\":\"https:\\\\u002F\\\\u002Fwww.usnews.com\\\\u002Fdims4\\\\u002FUSNEWS\\\\u002F40351df\\\\u002F2147483647\\\\u002Fthumbnail\\\\u002F300x300\\\\u002Fquality\\\\u002F85\\\\u002F?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.beam.usnews.com%2F29%2Fb7%2F72e9a69f4f138060dec967022b09%2Fkristen-hampshire.jpg\",\"@type\":\"Person\",\"jobTitle\":\"Contributor\",\"name\":\"Kristen Hampshire\",\"url\":\"https:\\\\u002F\\\\u002Fwww.usnews.com\\\\u002Ftopics\\\\u002Fauthor\\\\u002Fkristen-hampshire\"}],\"description\":\"Read U.S. News\\' review of Freedom Mortgage and compare interest rates, fees and terms to find the best loan for you.\",\"Product\":{\"image\":{\"@type\":\"ImageObject\",\"url\":\"https:\\\\u002F\\\\u002Fwww.usnews.com\\\\u002Fdims4\\\\u002FUSNEWS\\\\u002F9db40dd\\\\u002F2147483647\\\\u002Fthumbnail\\\\u002F300x300\\\\u002Fquality\\\\u002F85\\\\u002F?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.beam.usnews.com%2F56%2F35%2F11886ec34513be5af2e7daf87a16%2F190116-freedommortgagelogo-submitted.png\"},\"@type\":\"Product\",\"name\":\"Freedom Mortgage\",\"description\":\"Read U.S. News\\' review of Freedom Mortgage and compare interest rates, fees and terms to find the best loan for you.\",\"aggregateRating\":{\"reviewCount\":\"1\",\"@type\":\"AggregateRating\",\"ratingValue\":3.9}},\"dateModified\":\"2022-07-20T09:00-0400\",\"mainEntityOfPage\":{\"@type\":\"WebPage\",\"name\":\"Freedom Mortgage Review\",\"@id\":\"https:\\\\u002F\\\\u002Fmoney.usnews.com\\\\u002Floans\\\\u002Fmortgages\\\\u002Freviews\\\\u002Ffreedom-mortgage\",\"url\":\"https:\\\\u002F\\\\u002Fmoney.usnews.com\\\\u002Floans\\\\u002Fmortgages\\\\u002Freviews\\\\u002Ffreedom-mortgage\"},\"@context\":\"http:\\\\u002F\\\\u002Fwww.schema.org\",\"datePublished\":\"2022-07-20T09:00-0400\",\"dateCreated\":\"2022-07-20T09:00-0400\",\"publisher\":{\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"name\":\"U.S. News & World Report\",\"logo\":{\"@type\":\"ImageObject\",\"width\":193,\"url\":\"https:\\\\u002F\\\\u002Fwww.usnews.com\\\\u002Fstatic\\\\u002Fimages\\\\u002Fusn-logo-print.png\",\"height\":46}},\"headline\":\"Freedom Mortgage Review\",\"thumbnailUrl\":\"https:\\\\u002F\\\\u002Fwww.usnews.com\\\\u002Fdims4\\\\u002FUSNEWS\\\\u002Fd004839\\\\u002F2147483647\\\\u002Fthumbnail\\\\u002F80x60\\\\u002Fquality\\\\u002F85\\\\u002F?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.beam.usnews.com%2F56%2F35%2F11886ec34513be5af2e7daf87a16%2F190116-freedommortgagelogo-submitted.png\"},\"refinance_variable_apr\":\"\",\"id\":\"00000168-5850-d6ad-ab7d-fdda685a0000\",\"overline\":{\"new_window\":false,\"text\":\"Mortgages and Advice\",\"permalink\":\"\",\"url\":\"https:\\\\u002F\\\\u002Fmoney.usnews.com\\\\u002Floans\\\\u002Fmortgages\"},\"headline\":\"Freedom Mortgage Review\",\"short_summary\":\"Founded in 1990, Freedom Mortgage is one of the country’s largest loan originators and services, operating in all but two states plus the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.

USAA offers:VA loans. VA jumbo loans. Mortgage refinancing.USAA’s refinancing options include VA IRRRL as well as conventional refinancing. The conventional option is only available to members who are refinancing a USAA mortgage serviced by Nationstar Mortgage, a subservicer for USAA. USAA does not offer:FHA loans.USDA loans.Home equity loans.USAA members can get preapproved within minutes on USAA’s website and receive a preapproval letter to help them negotiate with sellers. This preapproval letter can be used for up to 90 days. Prospective homebuyers applying for a VA loan also need a certificate of eligibility confirming they qualify for a VA loan. You can apply for the certificate of eligibility through VA.gov. After finding a potential home, members can work with a USAA loan officer to complete the mortgage application. During the application process, the buyer should provide current bank statements, income statements such as pay stubs and other supporting documents as needed. USAA then reviews the application to make sure additional information isn\\'t needed, the title is clear and supporting documents match the application. When you\\'re approved and you’re ready to close on the house, you’ll need to bring your ID, as well as a cashier’s check or wire transfer to cover any down payment and closing costs that may apply. There’s no origination fee for VA loans, VA IRRRL and VA jumbo loans through USAA. The lender also covers appraisal, title and funding fees for VA IRRRLs. VA loans don’t require private mortgage insurance, and they usually don’t require a down payment – though a down payment may be required in certain circumstances. Homebuyers who get a VA loan, however, may need to pay a nonrefundable VA funding fee. This one-time fee is collected at closing and is determined by the loan amount, the borrower’s service history and other factors. Conventional refinance rate and term loans are available to USAA members who have their USAA mortgage serviced by Nationstar Mortgage, and these charge an origination fee. The origination fee is a flat $1,295 for amounts of $129,500 or more, or 1% for amounts of less than $129,500. USAA offers 10-, 15-, 20- and 30-year fixed rates. USAA doesn’t offer any discounts on mortgage products. But members can save up to 10% on insurance when bundling auto and homeowners insurance through USAA. USAA requires military affiliation to become a member and apply for mortgage products. You must be an active military member, former military with an honorable discharge or an eligible family member.Loans are available from $50,000 to $3 million. USAA does not disclose a maximum debt-to-income ratio. The minimum credit score for a VA loan through USAA is 640.  USAA offers its mortgage products on properties in all 50 states and Washington, D.C.  USAA has an A+ Better Business Bureau rating, but it is not BBB accredited. In 2021, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau received 32 mortgage-related complaints for USAA, with a timely response for all. The company closed 27 complaints with an explanation, two with monetary relief and three with nonmonetary relief. USAA has a 4.0 out of 5 stars overall mortgage rating from U.S. News, 4.5 for affordability, 3.0 for eligibility and 3.8 for customer service. The median overall rating for mortgage lenders in U.S. News ratings is 4.2.Members can reach USAA’s customer service department by phone Monday through Friday. For questions about new loans, members can call 800-531-0341 from 7 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. Central time, Monday through Friday. For questions about loans in process, members can call 800-531-8781 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Central time, Monday through Friday.

Home equity loans and lines of credit. Cash-out refinances. Conventional refinances. Axos Bank originates conventional and nonconforming loans, Department of Veterans Affairs and FHA loans with low- and no-down-payment options, interest-only mortgages, and investment property loans. Specialty loans from Axos Bank also help foreign nationals achieve home ownership.Loans can be used for many property types, from single-family homes to multistory condo complexes. Alternatively, borrowers can finance home improvements or pay off debts with an Axos Bank home equity loan or line of credit, or use a cash-out refinance to pay medical bills or education expenses. Axos Bank also offers refinance options to match goals such as lowering your monthly payment, removing mortgage insurance, switching to a fixed rate or paying off your mortgage faster. You’ll start the mortgage application process online by answering a series of basic questions about the type of mortgage you want and then receive a free quote. After you submit the initial mortgage application digitally, an Axos Bank loan consultant will contact you. You can upload to your online application all required documents, such as bank statements, W-2s and pay stubs. Checking the status of your loan application and tracking its progress can also be accomplished online. Axos Bank typically closes mortgages within 30 days. But if you are preapproved and prequalified, Axos Bank might be able to close sooner. The longest mortgage loan term Axos Bank offers is 30 years, and the shortest term is 10 years. The best interest rates are available with 15- and 30-year terms. Interest rates can be fixed or adjustable. Borrowers can save up to $995 on the lender fee and earn 3% cash back annually by opening an Axos Bank checking account and using it to pay the mortgage.  At closing, borrowers are responsible for costs such as discount points, loan origination and appraisal fees, surveys, and title and homeowners insurance premiums. Closing costs on Axos Bank mortgages can add up to 8% of a home’s purchase price, according to the lender.  Axos Bank will cancel automatic payments on your account if you have three or more consecutive returned payments. (You can avoid this by making sure your account information is up to date.) Axos Bank discloses late fees and penalties in its mortgage contract. Axos Bank offers mortgage discounts for borrowers who open an Axos Bank checking account. Save up to $995 on the lender fee for mortgages of at least $250,000 and $200 on the fee for mortgages less than $250,000. An Axos Bank checking account also earns 3% cash back annually – 0.25% monthly – when you pay your mortgage with it. The credit is based on principal and interest payments and does not include escrow, and borrowers can earn no more than $100 cash back monthly. Axos Bank offers online prequalification and preapproval. Loan amounts range from $15,000 to $510,000, with some exceptions. The lender’s jumbo loans have neither a loan limit nor a credit minimum.The minimum credit score to qualify for most Axos Bank mortgages is 620, which falls in FICO’s fair range. Government-backed FHA and VA loans generally require a “good” FICO credit score of 680. However, Axos Bank considers not only credit history but also down payment amount and savings. Axos Bank does business nationwide. Axos Bank has an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau, and Trustpilot scores Axos Bank 2.6 out of 5 stars, with complaints mostly related to customer service. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau received 25 mortgage-related complaints in 2020 about Axos Financial, the holding company for Axos Bank. Nearly half were related to trouble during the payment process. Each complaint received a timely response and was closed with an explanation.Axos Bank is an online bank but supports borrowers with mortgage consultants available at 888-546-2634 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. PST. You can also request information by completing an online form, and a loan consultant will contact you. When paying Axos Bank mortgages, you can choose automatic withdrawal from your Axos Bank account, make a one-time online payment or mail a check. A virtual financial assistant called Evo, accessible through the Axos Bank app or online banking, can be used to manage your loan, including scheduling and making payments.    The entire mortgage application process with this digital bank is completed online, including rate quotes or prequalifications. Upload all documents and check the status of your loan application online. Loans close online, and payments can be made through the Axos Bank mobile app or website. The lender requires a phone call after you begin the loan application.

New home loans include conventional loans, jumbo loans, Fannie Mae 3% down payment loans (specifically for first-time homebuyers), Federal Housing Administration loans, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs loans and U.S. Department of Agriculture loans.Homebuyers can also choose between fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages. For the fixed-rate loans, the most common terms are 15- and 30-year mortgages, but AmeriSave also offers 10-, 20- and 25-year loans. With adjustable-rate mortgages, the initial fixed-rate period lasts for five, seven or 10 years. After that, the interest rate adjusts annually.AmeriSave offers two basic refinance options: rate and term refinance, where you lower your current interest rate and change your mortgage term length, and cash-out refinance, where you use the accrued value of your home to pay off debts or make home improvements. AmeriSave also offers mortgage refinancing with FHA, VA and USDA loans. AmeriSave does not offer home equity loans or home equity lines of credit.The first step in the process is to fill out an online questionnaire and get prequalified, which can happen in as little as a day. AmeriSave offers certified approval, which gives you the ability to make an immediate offer once you find your dream home. Certified approval confirms your qualifications as a borrower and shows sellers that you have the financing available. It also locks in your rate for up to 90 days. Once you decide to lock in a mortgage rate, AmeriSave says half of its customers close a loan in an average of 25 days, while some have closed in as little as 10 days.AmeriSave has no application fee, but it does not disclose information about its origination fees or closing costs upfront. Mortgage rates will vary widely among borrowers depending on credit history, location and mortgage type. Fixed-rate home-loan terms range from 10 to 30 years, while there are three ARM options.AmeriSave doesn\\'t list any discounts on its website. However, its \\\\\"Certified Approval Closing Promise\\\\\" promises to pay you $1,500 if your loan doesn’t close. Talk to an AmeriSave representative to see if you’re eligible.The qualification restrictions at AmeriSave depend on the loan you are trying to get. FHA, VA and USDA loans have less stringent credit qualifications and lower down payment requirements than conventional loans. An AmeriSave professional will consult with you to find the best home loan program for your situation.For refinancing, your home value is a key deciding factor for qualification. An appraisal will be done to determine your home’s value, and if it\\'s more than the amount owed on your mortgage, you may qualify. You will need at least 20% equity in your home to qualify for a cash-out refinance.Credit score requirements vary by loan program. Borrowers need a minimum credit score of 620 for conventional loans and at least a 580 credit score for FHA and VA loans. A score of 640 is preferred for USDA loans, and required for FHA and VA loans larger than $700,000. Past bankruptcies or foreclosures may make it more challenging to qualify. AmeriSave will typically work with borrowers who are at least two to four years post-bankruptcy and seven years post-foreclosure. AmeriSave originates loans everywhere in the U.S. except New York, although physical locations aren\\'t located in every state. It also states not all mortgage products are available in all states. Is your dream home within reach? U.S. News\\' mortgage calculator will show you how much house you can afford.AmeriSave is accredited by the Better Business Bureau, where it has an A+ rating. On Trustpilot, AmeriSave has a rating of 4.3 out of 5 with more than 10,000 reviews. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau received 478 mortgage-related consumer complaints about AmeriSave in 2021, and all but three received a timely response from the company. Customer complaints mostly dealt with problems when applying for a mortgage, applying for refinancing and closing on a mortgage.AmeriSave offers a customer service hotline that’s available from Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Eastern Time by calling 888-700-4026. Customers can also reach out for assistance via email at customercare@amerisave.com. Borrowers can get sample rates and prequalify for a mortgage after filling out basic financial information online. AmeriSave also has a variety of online calculators to help you make borrowing decisions: a home value estimator to help you determine what your current home is worth, a calculator to help you decide if refinancing your mortgage makes financial sense, and a calculator to help you figure out how much house you can afford. Once you submit your loan application, you’ll have an account on My AmeriSave, where you can upload documents and track your loan’s progress toward closing.People who are considering a range of mortgage options.People who want to lock in a mortgage rate before they shop for a house.People who do not want to pay an application fee.\",\"@type\":\"NewsArticle\",\"author\":[{\"image\":\"https:\\\\u002F\\\\u002Fwww.usnews.com\\\\u002Fdims4\\\\u002FUSNEWS\\\\u002Fb3e3b6d\\\\u002F2147483647\\\\u002Fthumbnail\\\\u002F300x300\\\\u002Fquality\\\\u002F85\\\\u002F?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.beam.usnews.com%2F9a%2F38%2Ff57f13ce4234babf4d161426b285%2Fdawn-papandrea.jpeg\",\"@type\":\"Person\",\"jobTitle\":\"Contributor\",\"name\":\"Dawn Papandrea\",\"url\":\"https:\\\\u002F\\\\u002Fwww.usnews.com\\\\u002Ftopics\\\\u002Fauthor\\\\u002Fdawn-papandrea\"},{\"image\":\"https:\\\\u002F\\\\u002Fwww.usnews.com\\\\u002Fdims4\\\\u002FUSNEWS\\\\u002F78a9ead\\\\u002F2147483647\\\\u002Fthumbnail\\\\u002F300x300\\\\u002Fquality\\\\u002F85\\\\u002F?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.beam.usnews.com%2F29%2Faa%2F554c9ece49278e81fe8fae44d947%2Femily-hayes.png\",\"@type\":\"Person\",\"jobTitle\":\"Editor\",\"name\":\"Emily Hayes\",\"url\":\"https:\\\\u002F\\\\u002Fwww.usnews.com\\\\u002Ftopics\\\\u002Fauthor\\\\u002Femily-hayes\"},{\"image\":\"https:\\\\u002F\\\\u002Fwww.usnews.com\\\\u002Fdims4\\\\u002FUSNEWS\\\\u002F8c24174\\\\u002F2147483647\\\\u002Fthumbnail\\\\u002F300x300\\\\u002Fquality\\\\u002F85\\\\u002F?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.beam.usnews.com%2Fe0%2F4a%2Fb2d460fd4a06b5fa4b8381edde82%2Fwhitney-wyckoff.jpg\",\"@type\":\"Person\",\"jobTitle\":\"Managing Editor\",\"name\":\"Whitney Blair Wyckoff\",\"url\":\"https:\\\\u002F\\\\u002Fwww.usnews.com\\\\u002Ftopics\\\\u002Fauthor\\\\u002Fwhitney-blair-wyckoff\"}],\"description\":\"Read U.S. News\\' review of AmeriSave Mortgage Loans and compare interest rates, fees and terms to find the best loan for you.\",\"Product\":{\"image\":{\"@type\":\"ImageObject\",\"url\":\"https:\\\\u002F\\\\u002Fwww.usnews.com\\\\u002Fdims4\\\\u002FUSNEWS\\\\u002Fcc030fb\\\\u002F2147483647\\\\u002Fthumbnail\\\\u002F300x300\\\\u002Fquality\\\\u002F85\\\\u002F?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.beam.usnews.com%2Fd5%2Ff6%2Fbdcc0df9401ca8f23343682e68ae%2F210223-amerisavelogo-graphic.png\"},\"@type\":\"Product\",\"name\":\"AmeriSave\",\"description\":\"Read U.S. News\\' review of AmeriSave Mortgage Loans and compare interest rates, fees and terms to find the best loan for you.\",\"aggregateRating\":{\"reviewCount\":\"1\",\"@type\":\"AggregateRating\",\"ratingValue\":4.2}},\"dateModified\":\"2022-09-16T16:00-0400\",\"mainEntityOfPage\":{\"@type\":\"WebPage\",\"name\":\"AmeriSave Mortgage Loans Review\",\"@id\":\"https:\\\\u002F\\\\u002Fmoney.usnews.com\\\\u002Floans\\\\u002Fmortgages\\\\u002Freviews\\\\u002Famerisave-mortgage\",\"url\":\"https:\\\\u002F\\\\u002Fmoney.usnews.com\\\\u002Floans\\\\u002Fmortgages\\\\u002Freviews\\\\u002Famerisave-mortgage\"},\"@context\":\"http:\\\\u002F\\\\u002Fwww.schema.org\",\"datePublished\":\"2022-09-16T16:00-0400\",\"dateCreated\":\"2022-09-16T16:00-0400\",\"publisher\":{\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"name\":\"U.S. News & World Report\",\"logo\":{\"@type\":\"ImageObject\",\"width\":193,\"url\":\"https:\\\\u002F\\\\u002Fwww.usnews.com\\\\u002Fstatic\\\\u002Fimages\\\\u002Fusn-logo-print.png\",\"height\":46}},\"headline\":\"AmeriSave Mortgage Loans Review\",\"thumbnailUrl\":\"https:\\\\u002F\\\\u002Fwww.usnews.com\\\\u002Fdims4\\\\u002FUSNEWS\\\\u002F5e074ab\\\\u002F2147483647\\\\u002Fthumbnail\\\\u002F80x60\\\\u002Fquality\\\\u002F85\\\\u002F?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.beam.usnews.com%2Fd5%2Ff6%2Fbdcc0df9401ca8f23343682e68ae%2F210223-amerisavelogo-graphic.png\"},\"refinance_variable_apr\":\"\",\"id\":\"00000177-cfde-d652-abff-fffea18e0000\",\"overline\":{\"new_window\":false,\"text\":\"Mortgages and Advice\",\"permalink\":\"\",\"url\":\"https:\\\\u002F\\\\u002Fmoney.usnews.com\\\\u002Floans\\\\u002Fmortgages\"},\"headline\":\"AmeriSave Mortgage Loans Review\",\"short_summary\":\"AmeriSave Mortgage Corp. is an online lender that has been in business since 2002.

Homebuyers can earn bonus money toward the grant, including when their campaign is shared on social media platforms through the links on the campaign page. Qualifying homebuyers in all states but Alaska and Hawaii may be eligible to get up to $2,500 toward down payment or closing costs with the Freddie Mac BorrowSmart Program. Borrowers must meet income requirements and complete prepurchase counseling. CMG Mortgage also offers the All In One Loan, which combines home financing and banking, allowing you to make deposits that lower your loan’s principal. Those funds are available for expenses, and interest is calculated on the average daily balance. The result is lower monthly interest payments and an ability to reduce the time it takes to pay off your loan. Specific requirements in addition to minimum credit score vary by product. Conventional loans, for example, require that the applicant have a debt-to-income ratio of 45% or lower. Some conventional loans have options for down payment requirements as low as 3% or 5%, but a down payment lower than 20% necessitates that the borrower pay private mortgage insurance. Government-backed loans also have their own requirements. To qualify for a USDA loan, prospective borrowers must meet income requirements and be purchasing a home in a USDA-approved area. Factors for FHA 203(k) renovation loan eligibility include that applicants must have a DTI ratio not exceeding 43%, the home must be the applicants’ primary residence and meet Department of Housing and Urban Development guidelines, and repair costs must be at least $5,000.  To qualify for a CMG conventional home loan, you’ll need a credit score of at least 620, though CMG will also figure in DTI, savings and down payment size. FHA, USDA and VA loans can sometimes have lower credit score thresholds. For example, you may qualify for an FHA loan with CMG Mortgage if you have a FICO score of at least 580. You may need a higher credit score to qualify for a jumbo loan; CMG says prospective borrowers hoping to get a jumbo loan should have a score around 680 or above.CMG Mortgage is licensed in all 50 states and Washington, D.C.

All Discover home loans have fixed interest rates and fixed monthly payments, offering predictability in budget planning. Discover does not offer mortgages for purchasing a property.To begin the loan application process, you can call Discover or apply online. Discover will access your credit report and ask you for your employment information, debt and expenses, and other information. Within three days of completing your application, you should receive a loan estimate. Discover will need various documents from you before you can be approved for a home equity or refinance loan. Some things you may be asked to provide include:W-2 tax forms and your tax returns from the previous two years. Names and addresses of all of your creditors, along with the monthly payments and total amount due of all current loans.Statements of current assets, such as individual retirement accounts, certificates of deposit, stocks and bonds. Account numbers and current balances of your bank accounts. Discover will arrange for a home appraisal; after the appraisal is complete and you submit your required documents, Discover will begin underwriting your loan. The lender says it will provide you with a closing packet that includes your loan details before your closing date. Discover suggests submitting your required information and documents online to speed up the loan process.Discover offers loans from $35,000 to $300,000, and loan terms can be 10, 15, 20 and 30 years. Annual percentage rates range from 4.15% to 11.99%, and monthly payments are fixed. The lender advertises no origination fees, application fees or appraisal fees, and no cash required at closing. Discover’s website says the lender pays all closing costs during the loan process.If you pay off your loan balance in full within 36 months of the loan closing, you’ll need to reimburse Discover for some of these closing costs, not to exceed $500. However, those living in Connecticut, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma or Texas aren\\'t required to reimburse closing costs. Discover\\'s website does not list any available discounts. Aside from meeting credit score requirements, prospective borrowers of a Discover home equity loan must meet other expectations to qualify. These include:Verifiable, consistent income. You\\'ll need to provide a recent pay stub and have an employment history of at least two years. Other documents are required if you\\'re self-employed. A history of responsible credit use. Paying your bills on time and keeping your spending in check can help you show lenders that you\\'re a safe risk. Sufficient equity in your home. Your home\\'s value plays a big role in determining how much you can borrow. To estimate the equity, subtract debts secured by your home (often this is just the mortgage) from the home\\'s estimated market value. The equity you need depends on the loan amount you want. Reasonable debt-to-income ratio. Discover requires a debt-to-income ratio of less than 43%. Discover has fixed loans from $35,000 to $300,000. The lender\\'s website says it can\\'t use commercial property, investment property or manufactured homes for a home equity loan.You need a credit score of 620 or better to qualify for a home equity loan with Discover. The lender’s website says loan amounts requested above $150,000 are only available to applicants with credit scores of at least 700. Could refinancing your mortgage save you money? Try U.S. News’ Mortgage Refinance Calculator to see if refinancing makes sense.Discover’s home loans site says, “Not all products are available in all states or for all loan amounts,” but it does not specify in which states its products are not available. Discover Financial Services has an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau. In 2021, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau received two complaints concerning Discover home equity loans and lines of credit, and both received a timely response.

Chase offers home lending advisors to assist you with the process. Once you\\'re happy with the terms of the loan, you\\'ll notify your advisor that you\\'re ready to proceed with the application.

Chase\\'s DreaMaker program allows borrowers with scores as low as 620 to purchase a home, though for other types of mortgages your score will likely need to be higher.

Home equity loans and lines of credit. Cash-out refinances. Conventional refinances. Axos Bank originates conventional and nonconforming loans, Department of Veterans Affairs and FHA loans with low- and no-down-payment options, interest-only mortgages, and investment property loans. Specialty loans from Axos Bank also help foreign nationals achieve home ownership.Loans can be used for many property types, from single-family homes to multistory condo complexes. Alternatively, borrowers can finance home improvements or pay off debts with an Axos Bank home equity loan or line of credit, or use a cash-out refinance to pay medical bills or education expenses. Axos Bank also offers refinance options to match goals such as lowering your monthly payment, removing mortgage insurance, switching to a fixed rate or paying off your mortgage faster. You’ll start the mortgage application process online by answering a series of basic questions about the type of mortgage you want and then receive a free quote. After you submit the initial mortgage application digitally, an Axos Bank loan consultant will contact you. You can upload to your online application all required documents, such as bank statements, W-2s and pay stubs. Checking the status of your loan application and tracking its progress can also be accomplished online. Axos Bank typically closes mortgages within 30 days. But if you are preapproved and prequalified, Axos Bank might be able to close sooner. The longest mortgage loan term Axos Bank offers is 30 years, and the shortest term is 10 years. The best interest rates are available with 15- and 30-year terms. Interest rates can be fixed or adjustable. Borrowers can save up to $995 on the lender fee and earn 3% cash back annually by opening an Axos Bank checking account and using it to pay the mortgage.  At closing, borrowers are responsible for costs such as discount points, loan origination and appraisal fees, surveys, and title and homeowners insurance premiums. Closing costs on Axos Bank mortgages can add up to 8% of a home’s purchase price, according to the lender.  Axos Bank will cancel automatic payments on your account if you have three or more consecutive returned payments. (You can avoid this by making sure your account information is up to date.) Axos Bank discloses late fees and penalties in its mortgage contract. Axos Bank offers mortgage discounts for borrowers who open an Axos Bank checking account. Save up to $995 on the lender fee for mortgages of at least $250,000 and $200 on the fee for mortgages less than $250,000. An Axos Bank checking account also earns 3% cash back annually – 0.25% monthly – when you pay your mortgage with it. The credit is based on principal and interest payments and does not include escrow, and borrowers can earn no more than $100 cash back monthly. Axos Bank offers online prequalification and preapproval. Loan amounts range from $15,000 to $510,000, with some exceptions. The lender’s jumbo loans have neither a loan limit nor a credit minimum.The minimum credit score to qualify for most Axos Bank mortgages is 620, which falls in FICO’s fair range. Government-backed FHA and VA loans generally require a “good” FICO credit score of 680. However, Axos Bank considers not only credit history but also down payment amount and savings. Axos Bank does business nationwide. Axos Bank has an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau, and Trustpilot scores Axos Bank 2.6 out of 5 stars, with complaints mostly related to customer service. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau received 25 mortgage-related complaints in 2020 about Axos Financial, the holding company for Axos Bank. Nearly half were related to trouble during the payment process. Each complaint received a timely response and was closed with an explanation.Axos Bank is an online bank but supports borrowers with mortgage consultants available at 888-546-2634 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. PST. You can also request information by completing an online form, and a loan consultant will contact you. When paying Axos Bank mortgages, you can choose automatic withdrawal from your Axos Bank account, make a one-time online payment or mail a check. A virtual financial assistant called Evo, accessible through the Axos Bank app or online banking, can be used to manage your loan, including scheduling and making payments.    The entire mortgage application process with this digital bank is completed online, including rate quotes or prequalifications. Upload all documents and check the status of your loan application online. Loans close online, and payments can be made through the Axos Bank mobile app or website. The lender requires a phone call after you begin the loan application. You can contact customer service, and a mortgage consultant will walk you through the process.\",\"@type\":\"NewsArticle\",\"author\":[{\"image\":\"https:\\\\u002F\\\\u002Fwww.usnews.com\\\\u002Fdims4\\\\u002FUSNEWS\\\\u002F40351df\\\\u002F2147483647\\\\u002Fthumbnail\\\\u002F300x300\\\\u002Fquality\\\\u002F85\\\\u002F?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.beam.usnews.com%2F29%2Fb7%2F72e9a69f4f138060dec967022b09%2Fkristen-hampshire.jpg\",\"@type\":\"Person\",\"jobTitle\":\"Contributor\",\"name\":\"Kristen Hampshire\",\"url\":\"https:\\\\u002F\\\\u002Fwww.usnews.com\\\\u002Ftopics\\\\u002Fauthor\\\\u002Fkristen-hampshire\"}],\"description\":\"U.S. News reviews Axos Bank Mortgage based on affordability, eligibility and customer service.

New home loans include conventional loans, jumbo loans, Fannie Mae 3% down payment loans (specifically for first-time homebuyers), Federal Housing Administration loans, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs loans and U.S. Department of Agriculture loans.Homebuyers can also choose between fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages. For the fixed-rate loans, the most common terms are 15- and 30-year mortgages, but AmeriSave also offers 10-, 20- and 25-year loans. With adjustable-rate mortgages, the initial fixed-rate period lasts for five, seven or 10 years. After that, the interest rate adjusts annually.AmeriSave offers two basic refinance options: rate and term refinance, where you lower your current interest rate and change your mortgage term length, and cash-out refinance, where you use the accrued value of your home to pay off debts or make home improvements. AmeriSave also offers mortgage refinancing with FHA, VA and USDA loans. AmeriSave does not offer home equity loans or home equity lines of credit.The first step in the process is to fill out an online questionnaire and get prequalified, which can happen in as little as a day. AmeriSave offers certified approval, which gives you the ability to make an immediate offer once you find your dream home. Certified approval confirms your qualifications as a borrower and shows sellers that you have the financing available. It also locks in your rate for up to 90 days. Once you decide to lock in a mortgage rate, AmeriSave says half of its customers close a loan in an average of 25 days, while some have closed in as little as 10 days.AmeriSave has no application fee, but it does not disclose information about its origination fees or closing costs upfront. Mortgage rates will vary widely among borrowers depending on credit history, location and mortgage type. Fixed-rate home-loan terms range from 10 to 30 years, while there are three ARM options.AmeriSave doesn\\'t list any discounts on its website. However, its \\\\\"Certified Approval Closing Promise\\\\\" promises to pay you $1,500 if your loan doesn’t close. Talk to an AmeriSave representative to see if you’re eligible.The qualification restrictions at AmeriSave depend on the loan you are trying to get. FHA, VA and USDA loans have less stringent credit qualifications and lower down payment requirements than conventional loans. An AmeriSave professional will consult with you to find the best home loan program for your situation.For refinancing, your home value is a key deciding factor for qualification. An appraisal will be done to determine your home’s value, and if it\\'s more than the amount owed on your mortgage, you may qualify. You will need at least 20% equity in your home to qualify for a cash-out refinance.Credit score requirements vary by loan program. Borrowers need a minimum credit score of 620 for conventional loans and at least a 580 credit score for FHA and VA loans. A score of 640 is preferred for USDA loans, and required for FHA and VA loans larger than $700,000. Past bankruptcies or foreclosures may make it more challenging to qualify. AmeriSave will typically work with borrowers who are at least two to four years post-bankruptcy and seven years post-foreclosure. AmeriSave originates loans everywhere in the U.S. except New York, although physical locations aren\\'t located in every state. It also states not all mortgage products are available in all states. Is your dream home within reach? U.S. News\\' mortgage calculator will show you how much house you can afford.AmeriSave is accredited by the Better Business Bureau, where it has an A+ rating. On Trustpilot, AmeriSave has a rating of 4.3 out of 5 with more than 10,000 reviews. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau received 478 mortgage-related consumer complaints about AmeriSave in 2021, and all but three received a timely response from the company. Customer complaints mostly dealt with problems when applying for a mortgage, applying for refinancing and closing on a mortgage.AmeriSave offers a customer service hotline that’s available from Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Eastern Time by calling 888-700-4026.

These include an application fee, appraisal fee, credit report fee, origination fee, title search fee and other fees that vary depending on locality. If you find another mortgage with a better interest rate, Freedom Mortgage will match the competitor’s rate or give you $250. You may also buy discount points – which reduce your interest rate – for some mortgages, with one point equal to 1% of the total loan amount.You can qualify for a Freedom Mortgage loan if you have fair credit because the lender offers FHA, VA and USDA loans that have lower minimum credit limits than conventional mortgages. Qualifying for a Freedom Mortgage loan includes proving you are a U.S. citizen with a steady income and established credit. The lender will review your debt-to-income ratio and request your Social Security number, pay stubs, W-2s and bank statements. Ultimately, qualifying for a mortgage from Freedom Mortgage is about proving you have the means to pay back what it lends to you. Generally, a credit score of 580 to 620 is required for VA loans, but Freedom Mortgage will work with borrowers who have a credit score lower than 580. As for FHA loans, the minimum credit score is 540. Freedom Mortgage does not disclose a minimum credit score for all of its loans, but says it focuses on providing homeownership opportunities for borrowers, so the lender will look beyond the credit score and consider credit history, payment history, debt-to-income ratio, income and employment. Freedom Mortgage has a B+ rating with the Better Business Bureau and is a BBB-accredited business. It closed 499 complaints during the last 12 months. The lender addressed complaints within a few weeks. TrustPilot gives Freedom Mortgage 2.5 out of 5 stars, based on 12 reviews. In 2021, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau fielded 760 complaints about Freedom Mortgage loans. The most common complaints involved trouble during the payment process and applying for a mortgage. The lender responded in a timely manner to all complaints; 742 closed with explanation, and 18 were in progress as of January 2022. Freedom Mortgage doesn’t offer online prequalification and application processes. You can fill out an online form with your contact information, and a loan advisor will contact you. For some borrowers who prefer to do business online, this could be an inconvenience. But the benefit of an in-person or on-the-phone application process is a loan advisor will walk you through the application and answer your questions, ensuring that all steps are properly completed. As your loan closes, you’ll work with a scheduling coordinator who acts as an advocate and ushers the application to the final close. After this, Freedom Mortgage does have online tools so you can manage your account and pay bills online. People who would rather not apply for a loan onlineBorrowers who want a lender that is experienced with VA and FHA loansResidents of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands FAQs About Freedom Mortgage LoansQ: How do Freedom Mortgage loans work?Freedom Mortgage offers a range of home loans, including FHA, VA, USDA, conventional, adjustable-rate, jumbo and refinancing. If you want to apply for a Freedom Mortgage loan, you can compare the products online and fill out a form so a loan advisor will call you. You cannot complete the prequalification or application processes online, but you will be able to manage your account online once your loan closes. Q: Is Freedom Mortgage legit?Freedom Mortgage has a B+ rating from the Better Business Bureau and received 493 complaints during the last 12 months, which the lender addressed in a timely manner. TrustPilot gives Freedom Mortgage 2.5 out of 5 stars, which is a lower ranking than other mortgage lenders we profiled. Sixty percent of the reviews were “bad” on TrustPilot. Meanwhile, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau received 773 complaints about Freedom Mortgage loans, and the lender responded in a reasonable amount of time. Q: How do you get approved for a Freedom Mortgage loan?You get approved for a Freedom Mortgage loan by first prequalifying and then completing the application process, which involves proving you are U.S. citizen, showing you have a steady income, reporting annual income and providing your Social Security number. Freedom Mortgage pulls your credit report to review your score, credit history, payment history and debt-to-income ratio. Because Freedom Mortgage provides FHA, VA and USDA loans, the minimum credit score is lower than what might be required for a conventional loan from a conservative lender.

A term loan may be best if you are borrowing for a specific investment, such as a new project or large purchase, according to the lender. You will get a lump sum of cash and repay it over a fixed term.On the other hand, a line of credit may be better if you need quick access to working capital for short-term needs, such as purchasing inventory or paying bills. OnDeck\\'s revolving line of credit allows you to withdraw money as needed up to a certain amount, and the line replenishes as you repay it. You only pay interest on what you borrow. OnDeck cannot serve certain restricted industries – such as nonprofits, money services businesses and firearms vendors – and does not lend to businesses in Nevada, North Dakota or South Dakota.Start by completing an application for an OnDeck business loan either online or by phone at 888-269-4246. Be prepared to provide basic information about yourself and your business. OnDeck may ask for your business tax ID number, last three months of business bank statements, Social Security number, and driver\\'s license number and state of issuance. You may receive a decision in minutes. If you are approved for a loan and accept the offer, you may receive your money in as little as 24 hours. OnDeck\\'s short-term loans have repayment terms of up to 24 months, and lines of credit come with 12-month terms that reset with each withdrawal. Rates are determined by your company\\'s creditworthiness and cash flow. Loans carry origination fees of 0% to 4%. Once you\\'ve paid off half of your loan, you can apply to renew the loan and will not be charged any remaining interest on it. You may also qualify for a lower or 0% origination fee. An OnDeck line of credit has a $20 monthly maintenance fee, but it is waived for the first six months if you withdraw at least $5,000 within one week of opening the line.These are the minimum requirements for an OnDeck business loan or line of credit: Operate your business for at least a year.Have a personal FICO credit score of 600, which falls in the fair range.Make $100,000 in annual gross revenue.A business owner who wants to apply for an OnDeck term loan or line of credit will need a minimum FICO credit score of 600. OnDeck lends everywhere but in Nevada, North Dakota or South Dakota.OnDeck has an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau and an excellent rating of 4.7 out of 5 stars with Trustpilot, based on more than 3,300 reviews.

A term loan may be best if you are borrowing for a specific investment, such as a new project or large purchase, according to the lender. You will get a lump sum of cash and repay it over a fixed term.On the other hand, a line of credit may be better if you need quick access to working capital for short-term needs, such as purchasing inventory or paying bills. OnDeck\\'s revolving line of credit allows you to withdraw money as needed up to a certain amount, and the line replenishes as you repay it. You only pay interest on what you borrow. OnDeck cannot serve certain restricted industries – such as nonprofits, money services businesses and firearms vendors – and does not lend to businesses in Nevada, North Dakota or South Dakota.Start by completing an application for an OnDeck business loan either online or by phone at 888-269-4246. Be prepared to provide basic information about yourself and your business. OnDeck may ask for your business tax ID number, last three months of business bank statements, Social Security number, and driver\\'s license number and state of issuance. You may receive a decision in minutes. If you are approved for a loan and accept the offer, you may receive your money in as little as 24 hours. OnDeck\\'s short-term loans have repayment terms of up to 24 months, and lines of credit come with 12-month terms that reset with each withdrawal. Rates are determined by your company\\'s creditworthiness and cash flow. Loans carry origination fees of 0% to 4%. Once you\\'ve paid off half of your loan, you can apply to renew the loan and will not be charged any remaining interest on it. You may also qualify for a lower or 0% origination fee. An OnDeck line of credit has a $20 monthly maintenance fee, but it is waived for the first six months if you withdraw at least $5,000 within one week of opening the line.These are the minimum requirements for an OnDeck business loan or line of credit: Operate your business for at least a year.Have a personal FICO credit score of 600, which falls in the fair range.Make $100,000 in annual gross revenue.A business owner who wants to apply for an OnDeck term loan or line of credit will need a minimum FICO credit score of 600. OnDeck lends everywhere but in Nevada, North Dakota or South Dakota.OnDeck has an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau and an excellent rating of 4.7 out of 5 stars with Trustpilot, based on more than 3,300 reviews.

A term loan may be best if you are borrowing for a specific investment, such as a new project or large purchase, according to the lender. You will get a lump sum of cash and repay it over a fixed term.On the other hand, a line of credit may be better if you need quick access to working capital for short-term needs, such as purchasing inventory or paying bills. OnDeck\\'s revolving line of credit allows you to withdraw money as needed up to a certain amount, and the line replenishes as you repay it. You only pay interest on what you borrow. OnDeck cannot serve certain restricted industries – such as nonprofits, money services businesses and firearms vendors – and does not lend to businesses in Nevada, North Dakota or South Dakota.Start by completing an application for an OnDeck business loan either online or by phone at 888-269-4246. Be prepared to provide basic information about yourself and your business. OnDeck may ask for your business tax ID number, last three months of business bank statements, Social Security number, and driver\\'s license number and state of issuance. You may receive a decision in minutes. If you are approved for a loan and accept the offer, you may receive your money in as little as 24 hours. OnDeck\\'s short-term loans have repayment terms of up to 24 months, and lines of credit come with 12-month terms that reset with each withdrawal. Rates are determined by your company\\'s creditworthiness and cash flow. Loans carry origination fees of 0% to 4%. Once you\\'ve paid off half of your loan, you can apply to renew the loan and will not be charged any remaining interest on it. You may also qualify for a lower or 0% origination fee. An OnDeck line of credit has a $20 monthly maintenance fee, but it is waived for the first six months if you withdraw at least $5,000 within one week of opening the line.These are the minimum requirements for an OnDeck business loan or line of credit: Operate your business for at least a year.Have a personal FICO credit score of 600, which falls in the fair range.Make $100,000 in annual gross revenue.A business owner who wants to apply for an OnDeck term loan or line of credit will need a minimum FICO credit score of 600.

A term loan may be best if you are borrowing for a specific investment, such as a new project or large purchase, according to the lender. You will get a lump sum of cash and repay it over a fixed term.On the other hand, a line of credit may be better if you need quick access to working capital for short-term needs, such as purchasing inventory or paying bills. OnDeck\\'s revolving line of credit allows you to withdraw money as needed up to a certain amount, and the line replenishes as you repay it. You only pay interest on what you borrow. OnDeck cannot serve certain restricted industries – such as nonprofits, money services businesses and firearms vendors – and does not lend to businesses in Nevada, North Dakota or South Dakota.Start by completing an application for an OnDeck business loan either online or by phone at 888-269-4246. Be prepared to provide basic information about yourself and your business. OnDeck may ask for your business tax ID number, last three months of business bank statements, Social Security number, and driver\\'s license number and state of issuance. You may receive a decision in minutes. If you are approved for a loan and accept the offer, you may receive your money in as little as 24 hours. OnDeck\\'s short-term loans have repayment terms of up to 24 months, and lines of credit come with 12-month terms that reset with each withdrawal. Rates are determined by your company\\'s creditworthiness and cash flow. Loans carry origination fees of 0% to 4%. Once you\\'ve paid off half of your loan, you can apply to renew the loan and will not be charged any remaining interest on it. You may also qualify for a lower or 0% origination fee. An OnDeck line of credit has a $20 monthly maintenance fee, but it is waived for the first six months if you withdraw at least $5,000 within one week of opening the line.These are the minimum requirements for an OnDeck business loan or line of credit: Operate your business for at least a year.Have a personal FICO credit score of 600, which falls in the fair range.Make $100,000 in annual gross revenue.A business owner who wants to apply for an OnDeck term loan or line of credit will need a minimum FICO credit score of 600.

A term loan may be best if you are borrowing for a specific investment, such as a new project or large purchase, according to the lender. You will get a lump sum of cash and repay it over a fixed term.On the other hand, a line of credit may be better if you need quick access to working capital for short-term needs, such as purchasing inventory or paying bills. OnDeck\\'s revolving line of credit allows you to withdraw money as needed up to a certain amount, and the line replenishes as you repay it. You only pay interest on what you borrow. OnDeck cannot serve certain restricted industries – such as nonprofits, money services businesses and firearms vendors – and does not lend to businesses in Nevada, North Dakota or South Dakota.Start by completing an application for an OnDeck business loan either online or by phone at 888-269-4246. Be prepared to provide basic information about yourself and your business. OnDeck may ask for your business tax ID number, last three months of business bank statements, Social Security number, and driver\\'s license number and state of issuance. You may receive a decision in minutes. If you are approved for a loan and accept the offer, you may receive your money in as little as 24 hours. OnDeck\\'s short-term loans have repayment terms of up to 24 months, and lines of credit come with 12-month terms that reset with each withdrawal. Rates are determined by your company\\'s creditworthiness and cash flow. Loans carry origination fees of 0% to 4%. Once you\\'ve paid off half of your loan, you can apply to renew the loan and will not be charged any remaining interest on it. You may also qualify for a lower or 0% origination fee. An OnDeck line of credit has a $20 monthly maintenance fee, but it is waived for the first six months if you withdraw at least $5,000 within one week of opening the line.These are the minimum requirements for an OnDeck business loan or line of credit: Operate your business for at least a year.Have a personal FICO credit score of 600, which falls in the fair range.Make $100,000 in annual gross revenue.A business owner who wants to apply for an OnDeck term loan or line of credit will need a minimum FICO credit score of 600. OnDeck lends everywhere but in Nevada, North Dakota or South Dakota.OnDeck has an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau and an excellent rating of 4.7 out of 5 stars with Trustpilot, based on more than 3,300 reviews.

A term loan may be best if you are borrowing for a specific investment, such as a new project or large purchase, according to the lender. You will get a lump sum of cash and repay it over a fixed term.On the other hand, a line of credit may be better if you need quick access to working capital for short-term needs, such as purchasing inventory or paying bills. OnDeck\\'s revolving line of credit allows you to withdraw money as needed up to a certain amount, and the line replenishes as you repay it. You only pay interest on what you borrow. OnDeck cannot serve certain restricted industries – such as nonprofits, money services businesses and firearms vendors – and does not lend to businesses in Nevada, North Dakota or South Dakota.Start by completing an application for an OnDeck business loan either online or by phone at 888-269-4246. Be prepared to provide basic information about yourself and your business. OnDeck may ask for your business tax ID number, last three months of business bank statements, Social Security number, and driver\\'s license number and state of issuance. You may receive a decision in minutes. If you are approved for a loan and accept the offer, you may receive your money in as little as 24 hours. OnDeck\\'s short-term loans have repayment terms of up to 24 months, and lines of credit come with 12-month terms that reset with each withdrawal. Rates are determined by your company\\'s creditworthiness and cash flow. Loans carry origination fees of 0% to 4%. Once you\\'ve paid off half of your loan, you can apply to renew the loan and will not be charged any remaining interest on it. You may also qualify for a lower or 0% origination fee. An OnDeck line of credit has a $20 monthly maintenance fee, but it is waived for the first six months if you withdraw at least $5,000 within one week of opening the line.These are the minimum requirements for an OnDeck business loan or line of credit: Operate your business for at least a year.Have a personal FICO credit score of 600, which falls in the fair range.Make $100,000 in annual gross revenue.A business owner who wants to apply for an OnDeck term loan or line of credit will need a minimum FICO credit score of 600.

A term loan may be best if you are borrowing for a specific investment, such as a new project or large purchase, according to the lender. You will get a lump sum of cash and repay it over a fixed term.On the other hand, a line of credit may be better if you need quick access to working capital for short-term needs, such as purchasing inventory or paying bills. OnDeck\\'s revolving line of credit allows you to withdraw money as needed up to a certain amount, and the line replenishes as you repay it. You only pay interest on what you borrow. OnDeck cannot serve certain restricted industries – such as nonprofits, money services businesses and firearms vendors – and does not lend to businesses in Nevada, North Dakota or South Dakota.Start by completing an application for an OnDeck business loan either online or by phone at 888-269-4246. Be prepared to provide basic information about yourself and your business. OnDeck may ask for your business tax ID number, last three months of business bank statements, Social Security number, and driver\\'s license number and state of issuance. You may receive a decision in minutes. If you are approved for a loan and accept the offer, you may receive your money in as little as 24 hours. OnDeck\\'s short-term loans have repayment terms of up to 24 months, and lines of credit come with 12-month terms that reset with each withdrawal. Rates are determined by your company\\'s creditworthiness and cash flow. Loans carry origination fees of 0% to 4%. Once you\\'ve paid off half of your loan, you can apply to renew the loan and will not be charged any remaining interest on it. You may also qualify for a lower or 0% origination fee. An OnDeck line of credit has a $20 monthly maintenance fee, but it is waived for the first six months if you withdraw at least $5,000 within one week of opening the line.These are the minimum requirements for an OnDeck business loan or line of credit: Operate your business for at least a year.Have a personal FICO credit score of 600, which falls in the fair range.Make $100,000 in annual gross revenue.A business owner who wants to apply for an OnDeck term loan or line of credit will need a minimum FICO credit score of 600. OnDeck lends everywhere but in Nevada, North Dakota or South Dakota.OnDeck has an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau and an excellent rating of 4.7 out of 5 stars with Trustpilot, based on more than 3,300 reviews.

The book, Johns Hopkins Nursing Evidence-Based Practice, states: EBP is a problem-solving approach to clinical decision-making within a health care organization. It integrates the best available scientific evidence with the best available experiential (patient and practitioner) evidence (Dearholt & Dang, 2014, p. 4) The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) website defines EBP this way: The JBI considers evidence-based healthcare as decision-making that considers the feasibility, appropriateness, meaningfulness and effectiveness of healthcare practices. The best available evidence, the context in which care is delivered, the individual patient and the professional judgment and expertise of the health professional inform this process. In simpler terms, these are the three types of information that health professionals must consider when practicing evidence-based care: 1. Evidence pulled from the best available research. 2. Knowledge from their own expertise. 3. Values, needs and preferences of their clients. References • • Dearholt, S. L., & Dang, D. (2014).

Pain is considered to be one of the most adverse outcomes of a surgery. If not treated effectively, pain can lead to sleep deprivation, anxiety, and acute neurohormonal changes. Pain management in postsurgical patients requires high-quality care. Evidence suggests that a lack of encouragement or support of EBP research for postoperative pain management lowers nurses’ confidence in functioning efficiently (Mędrzycka-Dąbrowska et al., 2018). In this assessment, the scenario considered is that of a newly trained nurse assigned to a patient suffering from prolonged postoperative pain. It is the nurse’s first assignment, and she is not confident about implementing evidence-based practice in the context of the patient’s diagnosis. The focus of this assessment is to identify communication strategies that a head or senior nurse can use to encourage newly trained nurses to effectively research their patients’ diagnoses. Recommendations on how to evaluate credible sources during the research process and the criteria to be considered when selecting the best sources will be identified. Finally, a list of recommended sources will be provided along with the rationale behind choosing them. Communication Strategies to Encourage Diagnosis-Based Research Learning while on the job through structured mentoring gives new nurses a clearer idea of how to approach a problem. NURS 4030 Capella University Credibility of Evidence and Resources Discussion Paper\\nCompetent mentors help new nurses build confidence and enable an atmosphere that promotes communication within a practice. Mentors display personal characteristics such as empathy, respectfulness, and patience. They practice active listening by conducting unscheduled discussions frequently with new nurses to address queries. They Copyright ©2020 Capella University.

Online training or video-based modules have also added value to the learning process. Interacting through visual aids such as the Practice Nurse Postcard tool can help mentors communicate necessary information to new nurses (Dadich & Hosseinzadeh, 2016). The Best Places to Complete the Research Credible sources can be identified using the CRAAP test, which stands for the five criteria for evaluating an online source, namely currency, relevance, authority, accuracy, and purpose (Central Michigan University, 2020). The CRAAP test provides a handy checklist to identify credible online sources. However, nurses must ensure that they look for resources in the right places. Practicing nurses have had the best EBP-oriented research experiences in health care settings and clinical trials (Galassi et al., 2014). Additionally, it is recommended that nurses use the hospital or university library, hospital policy manuals, and hospital guidelines to complete their research. Identification of Five Sources for Evidence of Clinical Diagnosis Based on the factors indicated in the CRAAP model, five credible online sources have been identified. The sources are as follows: the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature database run by EBSCO publishing, the PubMed website (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) published by the National Library of Medicine, the Journal of Pain by the American Pain Society, the Journal of Pain and Relief, and the Columbian Journal of Anesthesiology by Wolters Kluwer. These sources provide validated information for research on postoperative pain management. Based on the CRAAP model, these five sources have been ranked in the order of their usefulness. Explanation of Why the Sources Provide the Best Evidence Copyright ©2020 Capella University. Copy and distribution of this document are prohibited. 4 These sources have been selected because they provide access to vetted, full-text articles from the most sought-after medical journals and peer-reviewed articles by practicing nurses, medical professionals, or research scholars in the field of medical science. These journals and websites provide information on EBP-oriented research on postoperative pain management, which is backed by scientifically collected data. These sources are regularly updated with the latest findings. Credible articles in these journals are easy to find and most of them are available free of cost. Conclusion Competent mentoring by using appropriate communication strategies can help nurses adopt EBP-oriented research in their practice. Support from mentors helps new nurses research effectively when they encounter new patient diagnoses.

Assessment 2 Instructions: Determining the Credibility of Evidence and Resources Develop a 2-4-page scholarly paper in which you describe a quality or safety issue, or a chosen diagnosis, and then identify and analyze credible evidence that could be used as the basis for applying EBP to the issue. The goal of using evidence-based research findings is to enhance safety and quality of patient care and ensure optimal outcomes are achieved. It is not uncommon to hear a nurse say, “why change it as we’ve always done it this way.” However, this is no longer acceptable in today’s practice environment. The profession of nursing has evolved, and the expectation is that the professional nurse has a scientific foundation to support the care that is provided. As the profession of nursing continues to evolve and engage in health care transformation, baccalaureateprepared nurses are expanding taking on leadership roles that include incorporating EBPs. To be able to do this, the nurse needs to understand the criteria and makes a resource credible, as this is crucial when deciding if the research is valid and reliable for implementation into health care settings. It would be an excellent choice to complete the Vila Health Determining the Credibility of Evidence activity prior to developing the report. The activity is a media simulation that offers an opportunity to review a scenario and work on determining the credibility of presented evidence. These skills will be necessary to complete Assessment 2 successfully. This media simulation is one potential source of context on which to base your assessment submission. This will take just a few minutes of your time and is not graded. Demonstration of Proficiency By successfully completing this assessment, you will demonstrate your proficiency in the course competencies through the following assessment scoring guide criteria: • • Competency 2: Analyze the relevance and potential effectiveness of evidence when making a decision. NURS 4030 Capella University Credibility of Evidence and Resources Discussion Paper\\nExplain criteria that should be considered when determining credibility of resources such as journal articles and websites. • • • • • • • Analyze the credibility and relevance of evidence and resources within the context of a quality or safety issue, or a chosen diagnosis. Competency 3: Apply an evidence-based practice model to address a practice issue. Explain the importance of incorporating credible evidence into an EBP model used to address a quality or safety issue, or a chosen diagnosis. Competency 4: Plan care based on the best available evidence. Describe a quality or safety issue, or a chosen diagnosis, that could benefit from an evidence-based approach. Competency 5: Apply professional, scholarly communication strategies to lead practice changes based on evidence. Communicate using writing that is clear, logical, and professional with correct grammar and spelling using current APA style. Professional Context As a baccalaureate-prepared nurse, you will be responsible for locating and identifying credible and scholarly resources to incorporate the best available evidence for the purposes of enhancing clinical reasoning and judgement skills. When reliable and relevant evidence-based findings are utilized, patients, health care systems, and nursing practice outcomes are positively impacted. Scenario For this assessment, you may choose from the following options as the context for the quality or safety issue or chosen diagnosis for researching and completing this assessment: • • • The specific diagnosis you identified in your previous assessment. The simulation Vila Health: Determining the Credibility of Evidence. A personal practice experience in which a sentinel event occurred. Instructions The purpose of this analysis is to better understand what constitutes credibility of journal articles as well as websites. The role of the baccalaureate-prepared nurse in incorporating evidence-based research continues to growth in clinical practice. As quality improvement (QI) measures to reduce safety risks continue to be emphasized, the need for evidence-based models and evidence-based templates is growing. This type of systematic approach to incorporating evidence-based findings allows nurses to make clinical and operational decisions based upon the best available evidence. When the most up-to-date evidence-based findings are utilized, patient-centered care improves outcomes and enhances the patient experience. For this assessment: • • • • • • • • • Explain the criteria that should be used when determining the credibility of journal articles as well as websites. Support your explanations with references to the literature or research articles that describe criteria that should be used to determine credibility. Your identification and determination of credibility should be done within the context of your chosen scenario for this assessment. For example, if you choose to use the provided Vila Health scenario, your initial identification of resources should be of resources that will best help address the presented issue. However, if you are locating resources to help provide evidence-based care for the diagnosis you identified in the first assessment, you may want to begin your literature and evidence search from the databases that identified. Any of the three scenario options are acceptable. So, pick the one that most interests you. Be sure to address the following in this assessment, which correspond to the grading criteria in the scoring guide. Please study the scoring guide carefully so that you will know what is needed for a distinguished score.

The book, Johns Hopkins Nursing Evidence-Based Practice, states: EBP is a problem-solving approach to clinical decision-making within a health care organization. It integrates the best available scientific evidence with the best available experiential (patient and practitioner) evidence (Dearholt & Dang, 2014, p. 4) The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) website defines EBP this way: The JBI considers evidence-based healthcare as decision-making that considers the feasibility, appropriateness, meaningfulness and effectiveness of healthcare practices. The best available evidence, the context in which care is delivered, the individual patient and the professional judgment and expertise of the health professional inform this process. In simpler terms, these are the three types of information that health professionals must consider when practicing evidence-based care: 1. Evidence pulled from the best available research. 2. Knowledge from their own expertise. 3. Values, needs and preferences of their clients. References • • Dearholt, S. L., & Dang, D. (2014).

Pain is considered to be one of the most adverse outcomes of a surgery. If not treated effectively, pain can lead to sleep deprivation, anxiety, and acute neurohormonal changes. Pain management in postsurgical patients requires high-quality care. Evidence suggests that a lack of encouragement or support of EBP research for postoperative pain management lowers nurses’ confidence in functioning efficiently (Mędrzycka-Dąbrowska et al., 2018). In this assessment, the scenario considered is that of a newly trained nurse assigned to a patient suffering from prolonged postoperative pain. It is the nurse’s first assignment, and she is not confident about implementing evidence-based practice in the context of the patient’s diagnosis. The focus of this assessment is to identify communication strategies that a head or senior nurse can use to encourage newly trained nurses to effectively research their patients’ diagnoses. Recommendations on how to evaluate credible sources during the research process and the criteria to be considered when selecting the best sources will be identified. Finally, a list of recommended sources will be provided along with the rationale behind choosing them. Communication Strategies to Encourage Diagnosis-Based Research Learning while on the job through structured mentoring gives new nurses a clearer idea of how to approach a problem. NURS 4030 Capella University Credibility of Evidence and Resources Discussion Paper\\nCompetent mentors help new nurses build confidence and enable an atmosphere that promotes communication within a practice. Mentors display personal characteristics such as empathy, respectfulness, and patience. They practice active listening by conducting unscheduled discussions frequently with new nurses to address queries. They Copyright ©2020 Capella University.

Online training or video-based modules have also added value to the learning process. Interacting through visual aids such as the Practice Nurse Postcard tool can help mentors communicate necessary information to new nurses (Dadich & Hosseinzadeh, 2016). The Best Places to Complete the Research Credible sources can be identified using the CRAAP test, which stands for the five criteria for evaluating an online source, namely currency, relevance, authority, accuracy, and purpose (Central Michigan University, 2020). The CRAAP test provides a handy checklist to identify credible online sources. However, nurses must ensure that they look for resources in the right places. Practicing nurses have had the best EBP-oriented research experiences in health care settings and clinical trials (Galassi et al., 2014). Additionally, it is recommended that nurses use the hospital or university library, hospital policy manuals, and hospital guidelines to complete their research. Identification of Five Sources for Evidence of Clinical Diagnosis Based on the factors indicated in the CRAAP model, five credible online sources have been identified. The sources are as follows: the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature database run by EBSCO publishing, the PubMed website (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) published by the National Library of Medicine, the Journal of Pain by the American Pain Society, the Journal of Pain and Relief, and the Columbian Journal of Anesthesiology by Wolters Kluwer. These sources provide validated information for research on postoperative pain management. Based on the CRAAP model, these five sources have been ranked in the order of their usefulness. Explanation of Why the Sources Provide the Best Evidence Copyright ©2020 Capella University. Copy and distribution of this document are prohibited. 4 These sources have been selected because they provide access to vetted, full-text articles from the most sought-after medical journals and peer-reviewed articles by practicing nurses, medical professionals, or research scholars in the field of medical science. These journals and websites provide information on EBP-oriented research on postoperative pain management, which is backed by scientifically collected data. These sources are regularly updated with the latest findings. Credible articles in these journals are easy to find and most of them are available free of cost. Conclusion Competent mentoring by using appropriate communication strategies can help nurses adopt EBP-oriented research in their practice. Support from mentors helps new nurses research effectively when they encounter new patient diagnoses.
